# DreadGOAD

A heavily modified fork of [GOAD (Game of Active Directory)](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD)
by Orange Cyberdefense. DreadGOAD deploys vulnerable Active Directory lab
environments for penetration testing and security research.

> **Warning:** This lab is extremely vulnerable by design. Do not deploy it on
> the internet without proper network isolation, and do not reuse any of these
> configurations in production environments.

## What's Different from GOAD?

DreadGOAD extends the upstream GOAD project with:

- **Go CLI (`dreadgoad`)** -- single binary for provisioning, health checks, trust verification, and vulnerability validation
- **AWS infrastructure automation** -- Terragrunt/Terraform modules for deploying labs in AWS with SSM-based management (no open ports)
- **Modular extension system** -- plug-in extensions for ELK, Exchange, Wazuh, Guacamole, and more
- **Variant generator** -- create graph-isomorphic lab copies with randomized entity names while preserving all attack paths
- **Ansible collection (`dreadnode.goad`)** -- 130+ roles packaged as a reusable collection
- **Multi-provider support** -- VirtualBox, VMware, Proxmox, AWS, Azure, and Ludus

## Lab Environments

| Lab | VMs | Forests | Domains | Description |
|-----|-----|---------|---------|-------------|
| [GOAD](ad/GOAD/) | 5 | 2 | 3 | Full lab -- the complete Game of Active Directory experience |
| [GOAD-Light](ad/GOAD-Light/) | 3 | 1 | 2 | Lighter variant for resource-constrained setups |
| [GOAD-Mini](ad/GOAD-Mini/) | 1 | 1 | 1 | Minimal single-DC lab |
| [GOAD-variant-1](ad/GOAD-variant-1/) | 5 | 2 | 3 | Graph-isomorphic copy of GOAD with randomized entity names |
| [MINILAB](ad/MINILAB/) | 2 | 1 | 1 | One DC + one workstation |
| [SCCM](ad/SCCM/) | 4 | 1 | 1 | MECM/SCCM attack scenarios |
| [NHA](ad/NHA/) | 5 | 2 | 2 | Ninja Hacker Academy -- challenge mode |
| [DRACARYS](ad/DRACARYS/) | 3 | 1 | 1 | Training challenge variant |
| [TEMPLATE](ad/TEMPLATE/) | 2 | 1 | 1 | Scaffold for authoring your own lab |

Vulnerability coverage varies by lab. The full GOAD lab is the richest, planting
50+ intentional misconfigurations spanning Kerberoasting, AS-REP roasting, ACL
abuse chains, ADCS misconfigurations (ESC1-4, ESC6-11, ESC13, ESC15), MSSQL
linked-server abuse, and delegation abuse. The smaller labs deliberately carry a
narrow subset: GOAD-Mini, MINILAB, DRACARYS, and TEMPLATE have no Kerberoastable
accounts or MSSQL instances at all, and SCCM concentrates on MECM/SCCM attack
paths. See [docs/GOAD-vulnerabilities-comprehensive.md](docs/GOAD-vulnerabilities-comprehensive.md)
for the full catalog, which is scoped to the full GOAD lab.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Ansible >= 2.15
- Go 1.21+ (for building the CLI)
- A supported infrastructure provider (VirtualBox, VMware, Proxmox, AWS, Azure, or Ludus)

### Install

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/dreadnode/DreadGOAD.git
cd DreadGOAD

# Install Ansible dependencies
ansible-galaxy collection install -r ansible/requirements.yml

# Install the CLI to GOPATH/bin (via go install)
task install
```

`task install` runs `go install` from the `cli/` module and places the
`dreadgoad` binary in `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`. Make sure that directory is on
your `PATH` so you can run `dreadgoad` from anywhere.

To build a local binary without installing it instead, use:

```bash
cd cli && go build -o dreadgoad . && cd ..
```

### Deploy a Lab

```bash
# Provision the full GOAD lab
./cli/dreadgoad provision

# Health check all instances
./cli/dreadgoad health-check

# Validate vulnerabilities are configured
./cli/dreadgoad validate --quick
```

For provider-specific setup instructions, see the [provider documentation](docs/mkdocs/docs/providers/).

### Generate a Variant

Create a randomized copy of any lab with unique names but identical attack paths:

```bash
./cli/dreadgoad variant generate --source ad/GOAD --target ad/my-variant --name my-variant
```
