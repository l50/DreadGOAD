!!! success "Thanks!"
    Thx to @ArnC_CarN for the initial work on the aws provider

The architecture is quite the same than the Azure deployment.

    LLMNR, NBTNS and other poisoning network attacks will not work in aws environment.
    Only network coerce attacks will work.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/?nc1=h_ls)

## AWS configuration

You need to configure AWS cli. Use a key with enough privileges on the tenant.

```bash
aws configure
```

- Create an AWS access key and secret for DreadGOAD usage
    - Go to IAM > User > your user > Security credentials
    - Click the Create access key button
    - Create a group "[goad]" in credentials file ~/.aws/credentials

        ```ini
        [goad]
        aws_access_key_id = changeme
        aws_secret_access_key = changeme
        ```

    - Be sure to chmod 400 the file

    !!! warning "credentials in plain text"
        Storing credentials in plain text is always a bad idea, but aws cli work like that be sure to restrain the right access to this file

## DreadGOAD configuration

- Initialize the configuration file with `dreadgoad config init`
- AWS-specific settings are configured in `dreadgoad.yaml`:

```yaml
# dreadgoad.yaml
aws:
  region: eu-west-3
  zone: eu-west-3c
```

- If you want to use a different region and zone you can modify it (but this could break ami values in terraform)

## Change AMI value

- You can get the ami of Windows_Server with a query like that:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-images \
  --region eu-west-3 \
  --owners 801119661308 \
  --filters "Name=name,Values=Windows_Server-2016-English-Full-Base*" \
  --query 'Images[*].[ImageId,Name,CreationDate]' \
  --output table
```

- for ubuntu use this command :

```bash
aws ec2 describe-images \
  --region eu-west-3 \
  --owners 099720109477 \
  --filters "Name=name,Values=ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*" \
  --query "Images[*].[ImageId,Name,CreationDate]" \
  --output table
```

## Installation

```bash
# check prerequisites
dreadgoad doctor
# Create cloud infrastructure
dreadgoad infra apply
# Sync inventory
dreadgoad inventory sync
# Provision the lab
dreadgoad provision
```

## start/stop/status

- You can see the status of the lab with `dreadgoad lab status`
- You can also start and stop the lab with `dreadgoad lab start` and `dreadgoad lab stop`


## VMs ami

- The VMs used for DreadGOAD are defined in the lab terraform file: `ad/<lab>/providers/aws/windows.tf`
- This file is containing information about each vm in use

```hcl
"dc01" = {
  name               = "dc01"
  domain             = "sevenkingdoms.local"
  windows_sku        = "2019-Datacenter"
  ami                = "ami-018ebfbd6b0a4c605"
  instance_type      = "t2.medium"
  private_ip_address = "{{ip_range}}.10"
  password           = "8dCT-DJjgScp"
}
```

## How it works ?

- The DreadGOAD CLI uses Terragrunt/Terraform to create the cloud infrastructure (`dreadgoad infra apply`)
- The lab is created (not provisioned yet) and a "jumpbox" VM is also created
- Next the needed sources will be pushed to the jumpbox using `ssh` and `rsync`
- The jumpbox is prepared to run Ansible
- The provisioning is launched with SSH remotely on the jumpbox

## Install step by step

```bash
dreadgoad doctor                # check prerequisites
dreadgoad infra apply           # create cloud infrastructure with Terragrunt/Terraform
dreadgoad inventory sync        # sync inventory and sources to jumpbox
dreadgoad provision             # run Ansible provisioning via jumpbox
```

## Tips

- To connect to a host via SSM you can use `dreadgoad ssm connect <host>`
- All AWS elements are tagged with `<lab_name>-<lab_instance_id>`
