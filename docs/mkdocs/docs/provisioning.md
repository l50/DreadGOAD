# :material-ansible: provisioning

This page describe how the provisioning is done with goad.
The provisioning of the LABS is done with Ansible for all providers.

- First the GOAD install script create an instance folder in the workspace folder.

## Lab data

The data of each lab are stored in the json file : `ad/<lab>/data/config.json`, this file is loaded by each playbook to get all the lab variables (this is done by the data.yml playbook call by all the over playbooks)

## Extension data

If an extension need data it will be stored in `extensions/<extension>/data/config.json` but the loading must be done by extension install.yml playbook.

- Example with the exchange install.yml file :

```yaml
# read local configuration file
- name: "Read local config file"
  hosts: domain:extensions
  connection: local
  vars_files:
    - "../data/config.json"
  tasks:
    - name: merge lab variable with local config
      set_fact:
        lab: "{{ lab|combine(lab_extension, recursive=True) }}"
```

## Inventories

Ansible work with inventories. Inventories files contains all the hosts declaration and some variables.

- The lab inventory file (`ad/<lab>/data/inventory`) is not modified/moved and contain all the main variables and hosts association, this file stay as this and is not modified. It contains the lab building logic.

- The provider inventory file (`ad/<lab>/providers/<provider>/inventory`) is modified with the settings and copied into the workspace folder (`workspace/<instance_id>/inventory`) , this file contains variable specific to the provider and the host ip declaration

- The extension(s) inventory file(s) (`extensions/<extension>/inventory`) is modified with the settings and copied into the workspace folder (`workspace/<instance_id>/inventory_<extension>`) , this file contains variable specific to the extension and the extension host ip declaration

- The global inventory file `globalsettings.ini`contains some global variable with some user settings.


The inventory files are given to ansible in this order :

- lab inventory file
- workspace provider inventory file
- workspace extension(s) inventory file(s)
- globalsettings.ini file

The order is important as it determine the override order. hosts declarations are merged between all inventory and variables with the same name are override if the same variable is declared.

- Example : if i setup dns_server_forwarder=8.8.8.8 in the lab inventory file and dns_server_forwarder=1.1.1.1 in the globalsettings.ini file, the final value for ansible will be dns_server_forwarder=1.1.1.1

## playbooks

- Labs playbook are stored on the ansible/ folder
- Extension playbook is stored in `extension/<extension>/ansible/install.yml`
- The extension folder can call the main goad roles by using a special ansible.cfg file.

- Example of the exchange ansible.cfg file

```ini
[defaults]
...
; add default roles folder into roles_path
roles_path = ./roles:../../../ansible/roles
```

## Running Ansible from Docker

If you prefer not to install Ansible locally, you can provision from a Docker container:

```bash
# Build the container
docker build -t goadansible .

# Run provisioning
docker run -ti --rm --network host -h goadansible \
  -v $(pwd):/goad -w /goad/ansible goadansible \
  ansible-playbook \
    -i ../ad/<LAB>/data/inventory \
    -i ../ad/<LAB>/providers/<PROVIDER>/inventory \
    main.yml
```

`--network host` is required so the container can reach the lab VMs on the host-only network (e.g. `192.168.56.0/24`).

## Individual Playbooks

The `main.yml` playbook runs all steps in sequence. For debugging or partial re-provisioning, you can run each playbook individually. The order matters:

```bash
ANSIBLE_CMD="ansible-playbook -i ../ad/GOAD/data/inventory -i ../ad/GOAD/providers/virtualbox/inventory"
$ANSIBLE_CMD build.yml            # Install prerequisites and prepare VMs
$ANSIBLE_CMD ad-servers.yml       # Create main domains, child domain, enroll servers
$ANSIBLE_CMD ad-parent_domain.yml # Create parent domain
$ANSIBLE_CMD ad-child_domain.yml  # Create child domain
sleep 5m                          # Allow replication to settle
$ANSIBLE_CMD ad-members.yml       # Add child domain members
$ANSIBLE_CMD ad-trusts.yml        # Create trust relationships
$ANSIBLE_CMD ad-data.yml          # Import AD data (users, groups, OUs)
$ANSIBLE_CMD ad-gmsa.yml          # Configure gMSA
$ANSIBLE_CMD laps.yml             # Configure LAPS
$ANSIBLE_CMD ad-relations.yml     # Set ACE/ACL and cross-domain group relations
$ANSIBLE_CMD adcs.yml             # Install ADCS
$ANSIBLE_CMD ad-acl.yml           # Configure ACL attack paths
$ANSIBLE_CMD servers.yml          # Install IIS and MSSQL
$ANSIBLE_CMD security.yml         # Configure security settings (Defender, etc.)
$ANSIBLE_CMD vulnerabilities.yml  # Configure intentional vulnerabilities
$ANSIBLE_CMD reboot.yml           # Reboot all VMs
```

!!! tip
    If a playbook fails, you can usually just re-run it. Most transient failures are caused by Windows latency during installation. Wait a few minutes and retry.

## Stopping, Fixing, and Resuming Provisioning

Provisioning rarely succeeds on the first try without intervention. You'll often need to stop the process, fix an issue (inventory typo, playbook bug, missing variable), and resume from where you left off. This is a normal workflow — distinct from rebuilding the CLI itself.

### The workflow

1. **Stop provisioning** — press `Ctrl+C`. The CLI handles the signal gracefully and terminates the running Ansible process.

2. **Make your fix** — edit inventory files, playbooks, `config.json`, or whatever caused the failure. Changes are picked up on the next run since the CLI re-reads configuration each time.

3. **Resume with `--from`** — restart provisioning from the playbook that failed (or the one after the last that succeeded):

    ```bash
    dreadgoad provision --from ad-trusts.yml
    ```

    This runs `ad-trusts.yml` and everything after it, skipping playbooks that already completed.

### Choosing where to resume

Use `--from` with the name of any playbook in the sequence. The CLI runs that playbook and all subsequent ones:

```bash
# Failed during ad-members.yml — fix and resume from there
dreadgoad provision --from ad-members.yml

# Or re-run just a single playbook to test a fix
dreadgoad provision --plays ad-trusts.yml

# Re-run a single playbook against a specific host
dreadgoad provision --plays ad-data.yml --limit dc01
```

`--from` and `--plays` are mutually exclusive. Use `--from` to resume a sequence, `--plays` to cherry-pick specific playbooks.

### What the CLI handles automatically

You don't need to manually retry most transient failures. The CLI has built-in retry logic (default: 3 attempts) with error-specific strategies:

| Error Type | Automatic Fix |
|-----------|--------------|
| Fact gathering timeout | Reduces forks to 1, extends timeout |
| SSM transfer errors | Cleans up stale sessions, recreates ssm-user accounts |
| SSM reconnection | Waits for Windows reboot (2 min), then reconnects |
| PowerShell errors | Forces PowerShell interactive mode |
| MSI installer errors | Reboots failed hosts before retry |
| Network adapter issues | Applies adapter workaround flags |

Configure retry behavior with:

```bash
dreadgoad provision --max-retries 5 --retry-delay 60
```

### When to stop and fix manually

Stop and fix manually when:

- **The same error repeats across retries** — the automatic strategy isn't resolving it. Check the playbook logic or inventory.
- **You spot a configuration mistake** — wrong IP, missing host, typo in a variable. Fix it and resume with `--from`.
- **A playbook needs code changes** — e.g., a role has a bug. Fix the role, then resume from the affected playbook.

### Logs

Each provisioning run writes a timestamped log to the logs directory:

```text
logs/<env>-dreadgoad-<timestamp>.log
```

Check the log to identify which playbook failed and why before deciding where to resume from.

## Vagrant VM Management

Common Vagrant commands for managing lab VMs:

```bash
vagrant up              # Start all VMs (or create if first run)
vagrant up <vmname>     # Start a specific VM
vagrant halt            # Stop all VMs
vagrant destroy         # Delete all VMs (irreversible)
vagrant snapshot push   # Save a snapshot of all VMs
vagrant snapshot pop    # Restore the last snapshot
```

!!! warning
    `vagrant snapshot pop` can break domain trust relationships between servers. After restoring a snapshot, run the `fix_trust.yml` playbook to re-establish trusts.

## Disabling the Vagrant User

All VMs are deployed with default credentials `vagrant:vagrant` from the base templates. To remove this backdoor after provisioning:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i ../ad/<LAB>/data/inventory -i ../ad/<LAB>/providers/<PROVIDER>/inventory disable_vagrant.yml
```

To re-enable (e.g. for maintenance):

```bash
ansible-playbook -i ../ad/<LAB>/data/inventory -i ../ad/<LAB>/providers/<PROVIDER>/inventory enable_vagrant.yml
```

## Labs build

- Instead of call a global main.yml playbook with all the different tasks to do the goad script call each playbook one by one.
- In this way, there is a fallback mechanism to retry each playbook 3 times before consider it as failed.
- The list and order of the playbooks played are stored in the playbooks.yml file at the start of the project.
